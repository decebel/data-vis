examples for the data vis class I'm teaching at parsons. 

the first 4 examples are OF ports from Ben Fry's excellent book, "Visualizing Data"
 
* timePlot1_fromBenFry
* timePlot2_fromBenFry
* timePlot3_fromBenFry
* timePlot4_fromBenFry

**Note: they are slightly rewritten from the P5 code from the book (there's no floatTable class, it's a done with STL vectors, etc) but the core concepts are the same.
